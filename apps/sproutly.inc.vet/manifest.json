Players care for virtual trees inside the game, and these actions are directly linked to verified agroforestry projects on the ground. Sproutly’s purpose is to make climate-positive behavior accessible and engaging, while transparently funding long-term tree growth and measurable carbon removal. The app bridges play and impact by turning attention, time, and community participation into tangible environmental outcomes.",
