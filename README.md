### Create a directory

To create a unique id, you can append the name of the application to the reversed domain such as  `com.example.your-app-name`.  Your app directory structure should be look like this

```
â”œâ”€â”€ apps
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ com.example.your-app-name
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ logo.png
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ manifest.json
```

## Last but not least
When users interact with your application, the function names and parameters are encoded as hex values in clause data field which is not very human-readable. You can submit the ABIs on [b32](https://github.com/vechain/b32) to help the user understand more about the interaction details.
